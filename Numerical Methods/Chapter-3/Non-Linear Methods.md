## Introduction
Let $F: R \to R$.
We want to solve for $x$ s.t. $F(x) = 0$, where $x$ is called a `root`

Examples of `Non-Linear Equations`:
1. $2x^2 + 7 = 0$
2. $x - e^{-x} = 0$ (`Transcendental Equation`)

Typically, we can't find a closed-form or analytical solution to solve non-linear equations.
However, we can use iterative methods to generate an approximation.

`Example`: $Let \ k=0, 1, 2, \dots$.
As $k\to \infty ,\ \hat{x}_{k} \to \tilde{x}$, where $\hat{x}_{k}$ is an approximation.
