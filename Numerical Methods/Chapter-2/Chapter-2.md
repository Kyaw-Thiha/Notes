## Linear Systems
Consider $Ax = b$,
- where $A$ is $m$ x $n$ matrix
- $b$ is m-vector
- $x$ is n-vector

## Singular vs Non-Singular
Matrix A is singular if
- A has no inverse
- det(A) = 0
- rank(A) < n
- $Az = 0$ for some vector $z \neq 0$ 

Non-singular: 1 solution
Singular: 0 solution or infinite solutions

For 2D, we can think of it as lines intersecting one another for non-singular, and lines being parallel or exactly the same for singular.
