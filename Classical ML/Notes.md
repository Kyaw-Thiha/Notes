$y_{i} = f(x_i) + \epsilon_{i}$

$\hat{y} = \hat{f}(x)$

$\hat{y}^* = \hat{f}^*(x^*)$



1. Get data
2. Select model + hypthesis space
3. $L(\hat{y_{i}}, y_{i})$ = $(\hat{y}_{i} - y_{i})^2$
   $J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2N} \sum^N_{i=1} (\hat{y}_{i} - y_{i})^2$
4. Optimize the objective function

semi-postive matrix
$\vec{x}^T.A.\vec{x} \geq 0$ where $\vec{x} \neq \vec{0}$
which guarantees that we don't end up in saddle point

derive expected test error decomposition using KNN and link K with variance & bias

Why not linear regression in classification

XYZ-Hypothesis
At least $X$% of $Y$ will be $Z$
wher X is percent of target population
Y = the target population
Z = The target outcome

Eg: At least 25% of our swimmers will improve 50m splits by 0.1 per lap
AT least 25% of our FM swimmers will ...
ensure at 70%

Failure Modes
- Failure to Launch: Sales or marketing fail to reach 
- Failure of Operations
- Failure of Premise: Customer dun agree with the problem
- Fundraising Failure


Funding
Whats SAFEs?
Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)
- Delay dilution until conversion to priced shares
- Converts at BETTER of Discount or Cap Rate
- In liquidation, superior to common but below debt

Priced Round
Dilution = new money + SAFE + discount

Focus
Angels invest for $
VC invest for %
like Preseed: 25%
Series-A: 20%
Series-B: 15%

Amount
Identify top 3 measurable milestones to achieve in 12 months
Assume worst case & add 6+ months of projected turn
