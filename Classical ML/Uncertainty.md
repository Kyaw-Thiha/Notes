# Uncertainty

### `Aleatoric Uncertainty`
This is also known as `Data Uncertainty`.

- Intrinsic stochasticity in the data generation process.
- Measurements are noisy
- Data distributions overlap.

This can be improved by better modelling; not by more getting more training data.

### `Epistemic Uncertainty`
This is also known as `Model Uncertainty`.
This happen due to limited & biased data or bad architecture.

- Uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge of mapping from input to output.
- Model architecture uncertainty.
- Model parameter uncertainty.

This can be improved by changing the model or getting more training data.
