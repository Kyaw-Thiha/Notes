# The Bitter Lesson

## First Lesson
Focusing on `handcrafted domain knowledge based` ML models is not a good idea as it does not scale well.

Instead, focus on models that are general and take advantages of bigger compute (which is always increasing by `Moore's Law`).

And the two methods that scale well are `search` and `learning`.

## Second Lesson
The way our minds learn things is tremendously complex. 
So, instead of trying to find simple ways to represent our environment, we should build `meta-methods` that can find & capture this arbitrary complexity.

In other words, the search for good approximation of the world around us should not be taught by us, but rather by our methods.

Build AI agents that discover like we can; not necessarily just contain what we have discovered.
