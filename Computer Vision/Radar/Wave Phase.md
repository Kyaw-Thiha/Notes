# Wave Phase 
The phase of a travelling wave is defined as
$$
s(t,x) = \exp(j \ (2\pi ft - kx))
$$
where
- $s(t,x)$ is a complex `wave signal` for $\text{time } t$ and $\text{distance } x$
- $j^2 = -1$ is the `imaginary unit`
- $2\pi f$ is the `angular frequency` $(\text{rad/s})$
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the `wave number` 
	where $\lambda$ is the wavelength
- $\exp(j \theta)$ is the `complex exponential`

## Phase Accumulation
The phase accumulated over a distance is defined as
$$
\phi(x) = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} x
$$
where
- $\phi(x)$ is the `phase accumulated` after travelling distance $x$
- $\lambda$ is the `wavelength`
- $2\pi$ is the phase of `one full cycle` in radians
