`RAdio Detection And Ranging` $(\text{Radar})$ detects objects and measures their range, direction and speed using `radio waves`.

## How Radar Works

- Radar System emits `radio frequency` $(\text{RF})$ `electromagnetic` $(\text{EM})$ waves towards a specified `region of interest`  $(\text{RoI})$
- Object within the $\text{RoI}$ reflect back the $\text{EM}$ waves
- These reflected waves are captured & identified by the radar 

The `EM Waves` engage with different elements namely 
- `Antenna`: $\text{Diffraction}$
- `Atmosphere`: $\text{Attentuation, Refraction, Depolarization}$
- `Target`: $\text{Reflection}$

Note that `scattering` refers to the reflection of the incident $\text{EM Wave}$ from the surface of a target.

## Interference
In `radar technology`, the received signals from the targets are accompanied by interference of
1. Intrinsic and extrinsic `electronic noise`
2. Unwanted $\text{EM Waves}$ from `non-target objects` $(\text{cluttering})$
3. Unintentional $\text{EM Waves}$ generated by other `human-made sources`
4. Deliberate jamming emanating from an `electronic counter-measure system`

## Radar Waveforms
Radars can be classified based on different criteria like
- `Generation`
  How the radio wave is generated.
- `Modulation`
  How information is embedded into carrier waveform.
- `System Architecture`
  How the space is scanned.
