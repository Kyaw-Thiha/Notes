$\tilde{x}' = \tilde{H}.\tilde{x}$ where $\tilde{H}$ is an arbitrary homogeneous 3x3 matrix
To get non-homogeneous form, we need to normalise it.
$x' = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x'}{w'} , \frac{y'}{w'}\end{pmatrix}$ where $\bar{x}' = \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ w'\end{bmatrix}$
In other words, 
$$x' = \frac{h_{00}.x + h_{01}.y + h_{02}} {h_{20}.x + h_{21}.y + h_{22}}$$
and
$$y' = \frac{h_{10}.x + h_{11}.y + h_{12}} {h_{20}.x + h_{21}.y + h_{22}}$$
