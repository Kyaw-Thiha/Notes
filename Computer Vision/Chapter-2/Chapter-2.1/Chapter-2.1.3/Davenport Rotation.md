Davenport chained rotations compose of 3 rotations chained together in matrix composition to represent a 3D-rotation.

Davenport rotations = Euler Rotations $\bigoplus$ Tait-Bryan Rotations
- **Euler Rotations**: 
(z-x-z, x-y-x, y-z-y, z-y-z, x-z-x, y-x-y)
- **Tait-Bryan Rotations**: 
(x-y-z, y-z-x, z-x-y, x-z-y, z-y-x, y-x-z)

## Tait-Bryan Rotations
A special Davenport rotation in which first and third axes are perpendicular to each other.

## Euler Rotations
A special Davenport rotation in which first and third axes are overlapping to each other.
