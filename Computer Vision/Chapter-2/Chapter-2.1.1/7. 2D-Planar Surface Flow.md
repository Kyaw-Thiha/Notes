# Planar Surface Flow
#math #cv/transformations/2d/planer-surface-flow 

## Formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
x' = a_0 + a_1.x + a_2.y + a_6.x^2 + a_7.x.y \\
y' = a_3 + a_4.x + a_5.y + a_6.x.y + a_7.y^2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Properties
Given an image on a 3D plane, **planar surface flow** shows how points on that image move when the planar surface (camera usually) moves.
In other words, it is used to estimate the points
- after camera rotation
- of two images on **same** plane from different viewpoint
