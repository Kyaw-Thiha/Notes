# Lighting Models (Computer Vision / Graphics)
#cv/light #graphics 

This page summarizes the **major lighting models** used in computer vision (CV) and computer graphics.  
Each section links to a more detailed note.  

---

## Point Light Source
- Emits light from a **single point in space**.  
- Has **position**, but no size or shape.  
- Follows **inverse-square falloff**: $E \propto \frac{1}{r^2} \cos\theta$.  
- âœ… Useful for: simple CV setups, flashlights, lamps.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Point Light Source]]  

---

## Area Light Source
- Emits light from a **finite surface (rectangle, disk, sphere, etc.)**.  
- Produces **soft shadows** due to finite size.  
- Requires integration across the surface.  
- âœ… Useful for: realistic rendering, light panels in CV experiments.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Area Light]]  

---

## Directional Light
- Models light from an **infinitely distant source** (all rays parallel).  
- No falloff with distance.  
- Example: **sunlight**.  
- âœ… Useful for: outdoor CV, shadow studies, diffuse shading.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Directional Light]]  

---

## Spotlight
- A **point light with a cone of emission**.  
- Defined by **position, direction, cutoff angle, falloff exponent**.  
- Produces localized, directional illumination.  
- âœ… Useful for: robotics, flashlights, focused illumination.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Spotlight]]  

---

## Environment Map
- Represents illumination as a **function over directions** (spherical panorama).  
- Assumes **infinite distance sources**.  
- Typically stored as cube map or lat-long image.  
- âœ… Useful for: relighting, AR/VR, IBL.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Environment Map]]  

---

## HDR Environment Map
- Environment map stored in **high dynamic range (HDR)** format.  
- Preserves accurate radiance values across wide intensity ranges.  
- Captures sunlight + shadows + environment variation realistically.  
- âœ… Useful for: physically-based rendering, inverse rendering, relighting.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[HDR Environment Map]]  

---

## Skylight / Sky Models
- Analytical models of **daylight distribution** across sky dome.  
- Inputs: sun position, turbidity (atmospheric clarity).  
- Examples: **Preetham**, **Hosek-Wilkie**, **CIE Standard skies**.  
- âœ… Useful for: outdoor CV, autonomous driving, scene relighting.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Sky Models]]  

---

## Ambient Light
- Simplified **uniform illumination** from all directions.  
- Computationally cheap, but not physically accurate.  
- Ignores shadows and variation.  
- âœ… Useful for: baseline models, fallback assumptions.  
- ðŸ”— See: [[Ambient Light]]

## Key Takeaways
- **Local lights (Point, Area, Spot)** â†’ good for controlled setups and indoor CV.  
- **Distant lights (Directional, Sky, Environment maps)** â†’ essential for outdoor scenes and global illumination.  
- **Ambient light** â†’ useful as a simple approximation but not physically accurate.  
- **HDR maps** â†’ required for realism and physically-based CV/graphics applications.
