The main training strategy we are planning to try out is to train on layered strategic goals.
The main idea is to teach the agent in a very much similar manner to the way an actual military organization would plan to achieve its goal.

- Small tactical goals like concentrate fire on single unit, move units in single file, etc
- Operational goals like breakthrough, flanking, encircling, etc
- Strategic goals like gaining elevated region.
- Top-policy agent to determine things like sieze city-A.
