## Similar Game
- SC2 (AlphaStar) - RL + Imitation Learning
- Blitzkreig 3 - Supervised or heuristic

## Limitations
Why don't more strategy games adapt RL into their AI
- Large action/state space + training cost
- Hard to debug (need to retrain instead of jes changing rule)
- Cannot be 'locked' at different difficulty level

## Opportunity
- Turn-based ---> Limited action space
- Can design game to be optimal for RL-training
- Market is too small ---> no big companies wanna risk research

## Challenges compared to chess
- Different map size
- Bigger action space due to unit number + variety
- More varied starting positions 
(different player can have diff no. of units)
- Strategies are more 'open-ended' in nature
- Need to take into account of things like strategy vs tactical focus
