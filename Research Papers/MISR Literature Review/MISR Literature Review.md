# MISR Literature Review
### MISR (HSI)
These are the exact papers carrying out the task we are planning to do.
Currently, there are only 2 models that does this - one is 3D convolutional model, and the second is a non-ML model focusing on reducing computational cost.

### MISR (Non-HSI)
These are MISR, but applied onto non-HSI images.
They use a variety of techniques which could be transferrable for our model architecture.
Many of them use `Mamba`, `Transformers`, and `Diffusion` models.

### Fusion-Based
These are methods that try to fuse from different types of images.
The most common methods are `RGB + MSI`, and `LR-HSI + HR-MSI`.

### Single-Image Super Resolution (HSI)
These are images that focus on getting spatial-spectral relations on local & global levels in order to carry out super-resolution.

### Self-Supervised SISR
These are self-supervised method for training single image super resolution
