# Batch Inference Optimization 
 #llm/inference/optimization/batch-inference

## Overview
**Batch inference** is an optimization technique where **multiple inputs (or user requests)** are processed together in a single forward pass of the model.  
Instead of running inference **sequentially** for each request, batching allows the model to **share computation across inputs**, reducing latency per request and improving throughput.

Batching is one of the most effective ways to maximize **hardware utilization** during **Large Language Model (LLM) inference**.

---

## Motivation
- LLM inference is dominated by **matrix multiplications** in transformer layers.  
- GPUs and TPUs are highly parallel devices that achieve peak efficiency only when operating on **large batches of data**.  
- Without batching:
  - GPU utilization is low.  
  - Each request incurs overhead separately.  
- With batching:
  - More tokens are processed simultaneously.  
  - Better **throughput** (tokens/sec) and **cost efficiency**.  

---

## Types of Batching

### 1. Static Batching
- Collect multiple requests into a fixed-size batch.  
- Example: Batch size = 8 → Always wait until 8 requests arrive.  
- Pros: Simple, predictable.  
- Cons: Latency increases if requests are scarce (must wait for batch to fill).

---

### 2. Dynamic Batching
- Requests are dynamically grouped into batches based on arrival time.  
- Example: Every 20ms, group all pending requests into a batch (up to a max size).  
- Pros: Balances **throughput** and **latency**.  
- Cons: Requires a scheduler to manage grouping.  

---

### 3. Sequence Batching
- Groups requests with **different sequence lengths** into the same batch.  
- Uses **padding + attention masks** so that variable-length inputs can be processed together.  
- Modern frameworks (like vLLM, TensorRT-LLM) manage **KV cache efficiently** for different sequence lengths.  

---

### 4. Continuous Batching (a.k.a. "Streaming Batching")
- New requests can join an **already running batch** mid-inference.  
- Example: While generating tokens for Batch A, Batch B requests arrive and get merged at the next decoding step.  
- Avoids waiting for a batch to finish.  
- Used in high-performance LLM serving systems like **vLLM**.

## Implementation Example (Dynamic Batching with Transformers)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2").to("cuda")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Example requests
texts = ["Hello world!", "Batch inference is great!", "LLMs are powerful"]

# Tokenize and pad
inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True).to("cuda")

# Forward pass in one batch
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

print(outputs.logits.shape)  # [batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size]
```

Here, **3 requests** are processed in one forward pass.  

---

## Advanced Optimizations

### 1. KV Cache Batching
- In autoregressive generation, **key-value caches** (past hidden states) are stored.  
- Efficient batching must handle:
  - Different sequence lengths.  
  - Variable decoding progress across requests.  
- Solutions:
  - **PagedAttention (vLLM)** → Uses memory-efficient cache layout.  
  - **FlashAttention** kernels for optimized batched attention.  

---

### 2. Speculative Decoding with Batching
- Small draft model generates multiple tokens in batch.  
- Large model verifies them.  
- Reduces the number of passes for batched requests.  

---

### 3. Frameworks Supporting Batch Inference
- **vLLM**: Continuous batching + PagedAttention.  
- **TensorRT-LLM**: Optimized kernel execution for batched requests.  
- **DeepSpeed-Inference**: Efficient pipeline + tensor parallelism.  
- **Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI)**: Dynamic batching server for production LLMs.  

---

## Benefits
- **Higher throughput** (more tokens/sec).  
- **Better GPU utilization** (avoids idle compute).  
- **Reduced cost per request** in large-scale deployments.  
- **Scalable to thousands of concurrent users**.  

---

## Trade-Offs
- **Latency vs Throughput** trade-off:
  - Larger batches → better throughput but higher latency for each individual request.  
  - Smaller batches → lower latency but poor GPU utilization.  
- Requires **batch scheduler logic** in the serving system.  
- **Variable-length sequences** complicate batching → need padding or efficient cache management.  

---

## Practical Usage
- Best for **LLM deployment servers** handling multiple simultaneous users.  
- Critical in **production systems** (chatbots, APIs, translation services).  
- Works well with:
  - **Dynamic batching** → good balance of latency + throughput.  
  - **Continuous batching** → best for real-time, multi-user chat applications.  

---

## Summary
- **Batch inference** is a core optimization for LLM deployment.  
- Improves **throughput and hardware utilization** by grouping requests.  
- Can be implemented as **static, dynamic, sequence, or continuous batching**.  
- Modern frameworks like **vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, and Hugging Face TGI** provide highly optimized batching implementations.
