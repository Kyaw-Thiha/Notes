# ONNX Hardware Optimization 
 #llm/inference/optimization/hardware/onnx 

## Overview
**ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** is an open standard for representing machine learning models.  
It enables models trained in one framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to be exported and run efficiently across different hardware platforms.  

For **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, ONNX provides a way to optimize inference by:  
- Converting models to a standardized format.  
- Applying **graph-level optimizations**.  
- Leveraging **hardware accelerators** through ONNX Runtime.  

---

## Motivation
- LLMs require **massive compute** and **large memory bandwidth**.  
- Native PyTorch/TensorFlow inference may not fully utilize hardware.  
- ONNX allows **cross-platform deployment** and **hardware-specific acceleration** (GPUs, CPUs, TPUs, NPUs, FPGAs).  

---

## ONNX Runtime (ORT)
ONNX Runtime is the **high-performance inference engine** for ONNX models.  
- Optimized for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators.  
- Supports quantization, pruning, and graph fusion.  
- Provides APIs in Python, C++, Java, and more.

## Key Hardware Optimizations with ONNX

### 1. Graph Optimizations
- **Constant folding**: Precompute constant sub-expressions.  
- **Operator fusion**: Merge multiple small ops into one (e.g., MatMul + Add → Gemm).  
- **Elimination**: Remove redundant casts, reshapes, or transposes.  
- **Kernel selection**: Choose the most efficient implementation for target hardware.  

---

### 2. CPU Optimizations
- Uses **Intel MKL-DNN** or **OpenMP** for parallel execution.  
- Supports **INT8 quantization** for fast inference.  
- Exploits **vectorized instructions** (AVX-512, AMX).  
- Suitable for **low-latency inference** with small batch sizes.  

---

### 3. GPU Optimizations
- Leverages **CUDA kernels** for NVIDIA GPUs.  
- Uses **TensorRT integration** for even faster inference:
  - Automatic precision lowering (FP16, INT8).  
  - Kernel auto-tuning.  
- Memory optimizations:
  - Layer fusion.  
  - Reduced data transfers.  

---

### 4. Quantization with ONNX
ONNX Runtime supports **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** and **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**.  
- Supports **INT8 weights and activations**.  
- Can run quantized models on both CPUs and GPUs.  
- Common workflow:
  1. Export model to ONNX.  
  2. Run quantization tool (ORT Quantization).  
  3. Deploy optimized model with ONNX Runtime.  

Example (Post-Training Quantization in Python):
```python
from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_dynamic, QuantType

quantize_dynamic(
    "model.onnx", 
    "model_int8.onnx", 
    weight_type=QuantType.QInt8
)
```

---

### 5. Parallelism & Execution Providers
ONNX Runtime uses **Execution Providers (EPs)** to map computations to hardware.  

- **CPUExecutionProvider** → optimized CPU backend.  
- **CUDAExecutionProvider** → NVIDIA GPU backend.  
- **TensorRTExecutionProvider** → highly optimized GPU backend.  
- **OpenVINOExecutionProvider** → Intel hardware (CPU, iGPU, VPU).  
- **DirectMLExecutionProvider** → Windows GPU acceleration.  

You can select execution providers in priority order:
```python
import onnxruntime as ort

sess = ort.InferenceSession(
    "model.onnx",
    providers=["TensorrtExecutionProvider", "CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]
)
```

---
### 6. Deployment on Edge Devices
- ONNX supports **mobile and embedded runtimes**.  
- Optimizations like **INT8 quantization** and **operator fusion** make LLMs possible on:
  - Smartphones (Qualcomm Hexagon DSP).  
  - NPUs (Apple Neural Engine).  
  - FPGAs.  

---
## Example Workflow for LLM Inference with ONNX
1. Train or fine-tune LLM in PyTorch/TensorFlow.  
2. Export to ONNX:
   ```python
   torch.onnx.export(model, inputs, "model.onnx", opset_version=14)
   ```
3. Optimize the ONNX graph with `onnxruntime-tools`.  
4. Apply quantization (INT8).  
5. Deploy with ONNX Runtime, selecting the right execution provider (CUDA, TensorRT, CPU).  
6. Scale inference with batching and hardware acceleration.  

---
## Benefits
- **Cross-hardware portability**.  
- **Performance gains** from graph-level and kernel optimizations.  
- **Quantization support** for efficient inference.  
- **Scalability** from edge devices to data centers.  

---

## Trade-Offs
- Conversion may fail for unsupported operators (requires custom kernels).  
- Performance depends heavily on the **execution provider**.  
- Extra engineering overhead compared to native framework deployment.  

---
## Summary
- ONNX enables **hardware-optimized inference** of LLMs by providing a standardized model format.  
- Combined with **ONNX Runtime**, it supports optimizations like **graph fusion, quantization, and parallel execution**.  
- Runs across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators via **execution providers**.  
- A key tool for **deploying LLMs efficiently on diverse hardware**.
