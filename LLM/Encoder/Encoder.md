# Transformer Encoder — Detailed Walkthrough

This page breaks down the Transformer **Encoder**, explaining its components, inner workings, and how to implement one from scratch.

---

## ✅ What Is an Encoder?

An **encoder** is a module in the Transformer architecture that takes an input sequence (e.g. a sentence) and transforms it into **contextualized representations** using **self-attention and feedforward networks**.

Each token’s output depends not only on itself but also on all other tokens — giving the model **global awareness** of the input.

---

## ✅ What’s Inside an Encoder?

Each encoder consists of:
1. **Input Embeddings**: Word embeddings + [[Positional Encoding (Short)|positional encodings]].
2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Tokens attend to each other.
3. **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)**: Applied to each token independently.
4. **Add & LayerNorm**: Residual connections followed by normalization.

Multiple such encoder **layers are stacked** (e.g., 6 layers in original Transformer).

## ✅ Mathematical Walkthrough

### Step 1: Input
Assume 3 tokens with 2D embeddings:
$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Step 2: Self-Attention
Project to Q, K, V:
$$
Q = XW^Q, \quad K = XW^K, \quad V = XW^V
$$

Assume:
$$
W^Q = W^K = W^V = I \quad (\text{Identity for simplicity})
$$

Then:
$$
Q = K = V = X
$$

Compute attention scores:
$$
A = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{XX^T}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
$$

Compute:
$$
XX^T = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Scale and softmax each row to get attention weights (approximated):

$$
A \approx 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.42 & 0.16 & 0.42 \\
0.24 & 0.24 & 0.52 \\
0.20 & 0.13 & 0.67
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then compute:
$$
\text{Self-Attn Output} = A \cdot V
$$

---

### Step 3: Feedforward Network (FFN)

Apply FFN to each token (row) independently:
$$
\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
$$

Typically:
- $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{ff}}}$
- $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{ff}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$

---
### Step 4: Add & LayerNorm
Each sublayer output is wrapped in:
- **Residual Connection**: $x + \text{sublayer}(x)$
- [[Layer Normalization]]

---

## ✅ Encoder Stack

To build a full encoder, we stack N such layers (e.g. 6 or 12), and optionally include:
- Dropout
- LayerNorm before output

---

## ✅ Python Code: Minimal Encoder Layer (No Libraries)

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True))
    return e_x / np.sum(e_x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

def encoder_layer(X, W_q, W_k, W_v, W1, b1, W2, b2):
    # Q, K, V projections
    Q = X @ W_q
    K = X @ W_k
    V = X @ W_v

    # Scaled dot-product attention
    dk = Q.shape[-1]
    scores = Q @ K.T / np.sqrt(dk)
    attention_weights = softmax(scores)
    attention_output = attention_weights @ V

    # Feedforward network
    ff_input = attention_output
    hidden = np.maximum(0, ff_input @ W1 + b1)  # ReLU
    output = hidden @ W2 + b2

    return output
```

## ✅ Why Use Multiple Encoder Layers?
- Deeper layers allow tokens to accumulate more global context.
- Early layers focus on local structure, while deeper ones build abstract semantics.

## ✅ Summary

| Component        | Mask Type                           |

| Feedforward(FNN) | Per-token Transformation            |
| Add & Norm       | Stabilize and enable deep learning  |
| Stacking Layers  | Deeper representation               |
