# What to do if Learning fails?

There are limited no. of things we can do
- Get a larger `sample set`
- Change the `hypothesis class` by:
	- Enlarging it
	- Reducing it
	- Changing it completely
	- Changing the parameters you consider
- Change the `feature representation` of the data
- Change the `optimization algorithm` used to apply your learning rule.
