# What makes a great math explanation?
This note is derived from 3Blue1Brown's video and entails what makes a great explanation for a subject.

The main things are
1. `Macro Motivation`: Hook someone into the lesson
2. `Micro Motivation`: Motivating each new idea
3. `Clarity`: Using concrete examples to clarify explanations
4. `Novelty`: Approach from new angle
5. `Memorability`: Ask questions that are memorable

---
## Personal notes for TA
My main takeaway from the videos are

1. Try to motivate the student before starting the lesson.
   Good techniques to try are
	- Using real-world application
	- Using a tangible problem
	- Active Learning (Depends)
	- Historical Significance (Depends)
2. Outline main idea and develop intution.
   Only afterwards, introduce the algorithm.
3. One good technique is to start with naive solution.
   Then, refine the solution.
4. Keep concrete examples front & center for clarity.
5. Alternatively, use visual cues to help with abstract ideas.

### Macro Motivation

How well do you hook someone into the lesson as a whole?

You can also ask yourself this:
$$
\text{Have you generated a desire to learn?}
$$
`Motivation`: $10\%$
`Core Lesson`: $70\%$
`Broder Connection`: $20\%$

For motivation, $\text{Examples} > \text{Sweeping Statements}$

---
`Tangible Problem`
Instead of discuss abstract ideas, talk about something more tangible.

$\text{E.g: }$Why is it that when you hear a plane approaching, the pitch of its sound seem to slowly fall?
$\text{Youtube: }$ [Acoustic Interference (flying over our heads)](https://youtu.be/QFv3QPNU6hw?si=9r_xWyu-3yMWLs5o)

---
`Application`
Gives a real-world application of the concept.

$\text{E.g: }$How does the algorithm behind the Panorama feature on your phone work?
$\text{Article: }$ [Pleasing Panoramas and Matrix Multiplication](https://xperimex.com/blog/panorama-homography/)

---
`Nerd-sniping`
Discuss a very specific and niche problem to attract very specific viewers.

$\text{E.g: }$A cool puzzle 
$\text{Youtube: }$[The Coolest Hat Puzzle You've Probably Never Heard](https://youtu.be/6hVPNONm7xw?si=YTh3l-rpGcMRjlC-)
$\text{E.g: }$p-adic numbers
$\text{Youtube: }$[1 Billion is Tiny in an Alternate Universe: Introduction to p-adic Numbers](https://youtu.be/3gyHKCDq1YA?si=er5ibWmqZ7hoq0xZ)

---
`Historical Significance`
Show historical significance of a problem, and makes viewer feels like they're part of something bigger.

$\text{E.g: }$Provides overview of calculus over the history
$\text{Youtube: }$[This Is the Calculus They Won't Teach You](https://youtu.be/5M2RWtD4EzI?si=nNd1oFPprVvEhUEV)


$\text{E.g: }$Links different concepts together
$\text{Youtube: }$[What A General Diagonal Argument Looks Like (Category Theory)](https://youtu.be/dwNxVpbEVcc?si=RYpNu2lTutvbooQc)

---
`Active Learning`
Make learner feels like they are playing active role in the lesson

$\text{Eg: }$Change the learning experience based on input by learners
$\text{Article: }$[An Inverse Turing Test](https://calmcode.io/blog/inverse-turing-test)

---
### Micro Motivation
You can also ask yourself this:
$$
\text{Is each new ideo given a good reason to be there?}
$$

$\text{Eg: }$Outline the main idea & intuition for the topic, before mentioning the algorithm/equation.
$\text{Article: }$[How Ray Tracing (Modern CGI) Works And How To Do It 600x Faster](https://youtu.be/gsZiJeaMO48?si=jY54I_oVqm9frqBD)

$\text{Eg: }$Start with a naive but flawed solution, then progressively refine it
$\text{Article: }$[Differentiable Programming from Scratch](https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/)

---
### Clarity
If `motivating` a lesson determines how much attention and focus the viewer is willing to give you, `clarity` is how fast you burn through that focus.

`Keep concrete examples front & center`
Guide the reader to focus on one relevant pattern at a time.
Distill down to a simple version of an idea, before seeing how that fits into a broader, more general settings

Basically, 
- Focus on one or two concrete examples.
- Then, run simulations or tweaking them to run up against edge cases.
- Allow learner to build their own intuition, before general rules are presented.

$\text{Eg: }$
- [Clear Crystal Conundrums: A Multifaceted Intro to Group Theory](https://explanaria.github.io/crystalgroups/)
- [Why the Circle encloses the largest Area](https://youtu.be/CFBa2ezTQJQ?si=9c5GDVjG5D1j_so9)
- [A Finite Game of Infinite Rounds](https://youtu.be/LUCvSsx6-EU?si=2l_djGF7mG0rMeQK)

Note that the examples does not even have to be explicit.
The choice of what to show on screen when making general points is often a great opportunity to offer the viewer a concrete example to hold onto.
It does not waste time explaining or overemphasizing its importance.
$\text{E.g: }$[Hopfield network: How are memories stored in neural networks?](https://youtu.be/piF6D6CQxUw?si=CV7OF43FhwSW5k9V)

---
## Novelty
Choose topics that would be hard to find.

---
## Memorability
Ask a question that's so fun to think about.
Or provide such a satisfying aha moment that it stays with you long after watching/reading it.

$\text{E.g:}$
- [A Curious Track, or What Bikes Are Hiding From Us](https://youtu.be/l7bYY2U5ld8?si=O5V2BCcpt8Uw_fDR)
- [Involute Gears Explained](https://youtu.be/nrsCoQN6V4M?si=rTdIdXhmXoAf4kCJ)
