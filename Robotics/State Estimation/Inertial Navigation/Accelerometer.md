`Accelerometer` is a device used to measure the relative acceleration of the robotics system.

It is used in [[Inertial Navigation]]

`Mechanism`
- A seismic mass is connected to the housing by a spring.
- Acceleration will cause housing to move.
- But seismic mass' inertia will cause it stay in place.
- Hence, relative position of mass $w.r.t$ housing change.
- This change is measured to determine the acceleration

## MEMS Accelerometer
`MEMS Accelerometer` $(\text{Micro Electromechanical Systems})$ are modern variants which are built entirely from solid state components with moving parts.

An accelerometer can only provide information along one axis of motion.
So, `three` accelerometers oriented `orthogonally` are needed.
