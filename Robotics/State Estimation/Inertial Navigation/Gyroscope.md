`Gyroscope` is a device used to measure the relative rotation of the robotics system.

It is used in [[Inertial Navigation]]

`Mechanism`
- Contains either rotating mass or oscillating component.
- When rotating, orientation rotate away from the plane.
- A mass rotating on the plane will resist that change.
- Likewise, mass oscillating on the plane will resist.

## MEMS Gyroscope
`MEMS Gyroscope` $(\text{Micro Electromechanical Systems})$ are modern variants which are built entirely from solid state components with moving parts.

The most common type of gyro is `rate gyro`.
It provides the amount of change in angle per unit of time.

Three gyroscopes are needed to provide rotation information in three spatial axis.
